# Modern Library
A simple, interactive library web application where users can add and display books. Each book can be marked as read or unread, and the list can be managed by removing books. This is a basic example of how to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a functional and dynamic website.

## Features
Add a new book: A user can input the title, author, pages, and whether the book is read.
Display books: Books are displayed with their title, author, and page count.
Mark as read: A toggle button allows you to mark a book as "read" or "not read."
Remove books: A button next to each book allows the user to remove it from the library.
Responsive UI: The website is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the website.
CSS: Styling of the website (in the style.css file).
JavaScript: Adds interactivity such as adding, removing, and toggling book status (in the script.js file).


Add your own books: Click on the "Add a New Book" button and fill out the form to add a new book to your library.

Toggle read status: Click on the eye icon to mark the book as read or unread.

Remove books: Click on the trash bin icon to remove a book from the library.


## Example Books
The website pre-populates with a few books, including:

* Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling (Read)
* To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (Not Read)
* The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (Read)
* Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe (Not Read)

-You can add, edit, or remove books as you like.
